# Group Level Analysis

Similar to our single-subject object, `GroupLevel` points to output from the subject-wise first level models and constructs a second level model. Statistical testing is still in development.


## Required at this directory level

* Your BIDS root (e.g., `./bids/`)
* `grouplevel.py`
